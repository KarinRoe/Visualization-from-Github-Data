The data is from the 2017 GitHub Open Source Survey.

Here the data is mostly analyzed with regard to gender and minority groups to indicate diversity issues.
The survey was filled out mostly by man (91%, N=3387) and only 3% by woman(N=125), 1% by Non-binary(N=39) and 5% by people who would rather not give their gender (N=173)
